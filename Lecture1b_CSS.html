		Every box has a border, even if it isn't visible. It separates one element from the other.
	</p>
	<p>
		Margins sit outside the edge of the border, and can be used to create a gap between the borders of two adjacent boxes.
	</p>
	<p>
		Padding is used to insert a space between the border of a box and the content it contains.
	</p>
	<p>
		Paddings and margins can enhance the readability of the content of a box by creating white space.
